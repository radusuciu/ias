# Isotop Analysis Service (IAS)


## Use

Requires Python 3: `bash start.sh`. The setup script is mostly for me to use with the Linux Subsystem for Windows. 

Default secrets are found in `config/secrets.yml`, actual secrets go in `config/secrets-override.yml` - which should not be checked into version control.
